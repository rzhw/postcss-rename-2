/**
 * A SubstitutionMap that trivially renames its CSS classes by adding an
 * underscore. This may be helpful in debugging because it makes it easy to
 * match the renamed value with the original while helping catch bugs where the
 * CSS class name is hardcoded in the code. Example in Soy:
 * <pre>
 * // Case I: Hardcoded name (incorrect)
 * &lt;div class="CSS_MENU_BAR">&lt;/div>
 *
 * // Case II: Name used as variable (correct)
 * &lt;div class="{css CSS_MENU_BAR}">&lt;/div>
 * </pre>
 * <p>In Case I, the div would not get the effects of the CSS class when it is
 * renamed, so hopefully the missing styles would help discover the source of
 * the error.
