/**
 * {@link MultipleMappingSubstitutionMap} is a special type of
 * {@link SubstitutionMap} that can create multiple mappings for a single
 * lookup. This is particularly important with respect to CSS renaming.
 * <p>
 * For example, a {@link SplittingSubstitutionMap} may rename "goog-component"
 * as "a-b", in which case it has created two renaming mappings: "a" -> "goog"
 * and "b" -> "component", both of which are necessary to produce the full
 * renaming map.
 * <p>
 * Note that in the case of {@link SplittingSubstitutionMap}, the map that is
 * returned by {@link #getValueWithMappings(String)} does not contain
 * "goog-component" as a key because the entries "goog" and "component" are
 * sufficient to construct the renamed version of "goog-component". Therefore,
 * the key passed into {@link #getValueWithMappings(String)} is not guaranteed
 * to appear in the output.
